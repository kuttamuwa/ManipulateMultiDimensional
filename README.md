See examples for manipulating multi dimensional data. My test data are mostly is netCDF.
You can add your small size and attached a useful script to do anything on them.

I added reading, creating and manipulating ways of them. Georeferencing and warping also added.

If you have samples like I have, please contribute it. Because handling these ones and using 
gdal, rasterio and xarray are still is pain in the ass.
